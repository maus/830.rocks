# Colophon

We took our own sweet time to figure out the right photos, the nicest type and fonts, and to create the perfect color palettes.

Then we made sure it all looks good and, especially when it came to forms, is usable regardless of screen size. 

## Photography

We took all photos in one mirror or another in this or the other city. Coincidentally 3 were shot in Venice (a lot of opportunity during a Biennale visit) and the one that's more blue than image in Vama Veche (although you can barely tell it's us). 

Goes without saying that they are only to be used for this website.

## Illustration

The images on "The Big Day" are picked up from Viscri, a wonderful coloring book for grown-ups made by [Mădălina Andronic](https://illustration.madiandronic.com/about). They were thoughtfully and patiently colored by Ana.

## Typography

All typefaces are served by Adobe Fonts and pairings were made with talent and dedication. 

One could call using such a wide range of fonts going over board. They would be right, but rarely does Marius have the opportunity mix and match without being concerned about accessibility or the cellular internet speed of users.

In case you're interested, here they are:

- [Mrs. Eaves](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/mrs-eaves), a classic that Marius always wanted to use. The small caps font gives it that nice extra ooumph.
- [Roc Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/roc-grotesk), a sturdy sans that pairs nicely with Mrs. Eaves. The extra wide font has a special vibe that says party and sea without going too much overboard.
- [Gopher](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gopher) is a display font with an understated flair, pairing nicely with Roc Grotesk and looking just a little bit off.
- [Pinot Grigio Modern](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/pinot-grigio-modern) screams "Art Deco" while still being usable in a web browser. Needless to say, it harkens back to the glory days of Bucharest.
- [DIN 2014 Narrow](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/din-2014) is the body text of the art deco theme because you need something that's tall and skinny while still being readable to a reasonable degree.
