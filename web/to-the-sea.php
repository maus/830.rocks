        <h2>Why Vama veche?</h2>
        <p>Ana and Marius' first getaway as a couple was in Vama Veche.</p>

        <p>A small village at the seaside, before entering Bulgaria, the “Old customs” offers a unique experience for anyone that enters its premises. Known for its counter-cultural vibes from older times, its reputation precedes it. Even though it is not the unexploited, hippie village it used to be, it still has its charm. We invite you to welcome it, experience it and let the magic of this tiny village surround you. </p>
        <p>Bonus tip: if you can make it, watch the sunrise from <em>Stuf</em> beach bar, while they play Bolero. It is an unforgettable experience.</p>
