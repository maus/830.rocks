        <h2>Why Vama Veche?</h2>
        <p>Well, Ana and Marius' first getaway as a couple was in Vama Veche early August 2021.</p>
        <p>Quick history lesson: what used to be a small village by the seaside, right next to the border with Bulgaria, the “Old customs” offers a unique experience for anyone that enters its premises.</p>
        <p>(In)famous thanks to the counter-culture vibes of older times, its reputation precedes it. Even though it is not the anti-commercial, unexploited, hippie village it used to be, its charm is still there in parking lots rented for tents. We invite you to welcome it, experience it, and let the magic of this tiny village turned hipster sea resort surround you. </p>
        <p><b>Rocker move</b> if you can think you have it in you, stay up and watch the sunrise from <i>Stuf</i> beach bar, while they play Ravel's <i>Bolero</i>. It is an unforgettable experience.</p>

        <h2>Booking Wishlist</h2>
        <p>We want to reserve a few rooms in a couple of accommodations, so that we can spend time together/close to each other.</p>
        <p>Let us know ASAP if you want to join, so we can make reservations in time. Vama Veche is one of those places that every weekend is filled to the brim by people complaining of how full it is, no exceptions. We'll be there on Saturday, it'll be packed.</p>
        <p>For orientation, we did our research and the price ranges between €50.00 - €100.00 per person for 2 nights.</p>

        <h2>How We'll Get There</h2>
        <p>Not specified yet. We'll have a few personal cars, maybe we'll also need to spring for a rental van. Very much depends on how big of a crowd we'll be.</p>
        <p>We <strong>will</strong> leave on Saturday afternoon just as the hangover from the wedding clears up, and be back on Monday evening.</p>
