        <h2>Our Highlights</h2>
        <p>Not unlike the list that Google and TripAdvisor are happy to provide, these are our recommendations for a quick Bucharest city break.</p>

        <h3>The Palace of Parliament</h3>
        <p>The Palace of Parliament is the world’s second-largest administrative building (after the Pentagon) and former dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu’s most infamous creation.</p>
        <p>Built in 1984 (an not yet finished), the palace is one of the most controversial buildings in Romania. It is both a symbol of power as it is a reminder of the communist era.</p>
        <p><em>Fun facts</em>: The Palace of Parliament has 1100 rooms and covers 330,000 m³. It is constructed from 700,000 tons of steel and bronze combined with 1 million m³ of marble, 3,500 tons of crystal glass and 900,000 m³ of wood. Due to its weight, the building actually sinks into the ground a little bit each year. In any case you cannot miss it. Even if you want to. The building is so massive that it's even visible from the moon.</p>
